# Digital-Weighing-Scale
Arduino Code for Digital Weighing Scale using 5kg load cell, HX711 module, and Arduino Uno.

Do not touch the strain gauge on the load cell because they are very sensitive leading to inaccurate readings.

Do not forget to update the calibration factor as it might differ otherwise It won't show correct readings.

Weight limit for the scale is 5Kg only.

Download and import the libraries attached, if in case they are not present
